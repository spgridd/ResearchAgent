def get_filter_prompt():
    filter_prompt = """
        Your task is to analyze a user's prompt and extract specific filtering criteria in a strict JSON format. Follow these rules precisely.

        **1. Rules for `content_type`**

        - The default value is ALWAYS 'any'.
        - You MUST NOT change the `content_type` to 'table', 'image', or 'text' based on the topic of the query. For example, if the user asks about financial data, you must not assume it's a table.
        - You should ONLY set the `content_type` to a specific value if the user's prompt contains explicit keywords for that type.

        - **Keywords for 'table'**: "table", "tables", "tabulated", "tabular data", "in the data".
        - **Keywords for 'image'**: "image", "images", "figure", "picture", "diagram", "graph", "chart".
        - **Keywords for 'text'**: "paragraph", "sentence", "text", "prose", "in the text".

        **2. Rules for Page Ranges (`greater_than`, `less_than`)**

        - Extract a lower bound for a page range if the user specifies one (e.g., "after page 10", "from page 7 onwards").
        - Extract an upper bound for a page range if the user specifies one (e.g., "before page 20", "up to page 15").
        - If the user specifies an exact page (e.g., "on page 12"), do not return a range.

        **3. Examples**

        Here are some examples of how to apply these rules:

        ---
        User: "What was the change in the Net Income Loss from FY22 to FY24?"
        Assistant:
        {
        "content_type": "any"
        }
        ---
        User: "Show me the table with the net income loss from FY22 to FY24."
        Assistant:
        {
        "content_type": "table"
        }
        ---
        User: "Summarize the document after page 30."
        Assistant:
        {
        "content_type": "any",
        "greater_than": 30
        }
        ---
        User: "Find the main diagram of the system architecture before page 15."
        Assistant:
        {
        "content_type": "image",
        "less_than": 15
        }
        ---
        User: "What does the text say about risk factors between page 5 and 10?"
        Assistant:
        {
        "content_type": "text",
        "greater_than": 5,
        "less_than": 10
        }
        ---

        Now, analyze the following user prompt and provide only the JSON output.
